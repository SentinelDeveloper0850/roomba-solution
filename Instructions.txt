Thank you for the opportunity to do this challenge! It was challenging with the time constraints as I have not worked with VueJS, but overall enjoyable.

Please follow these instructions to run the application:

1. Open the root directory, install server dependencies, and start the server by running "npm install && npm run dev".
2. Open the client directory and install client dependencies by running "cd client && npm install && npm run serve".

I have chained the commands to make it easier. Simply copy and paste them to run the application.

Happy testing!
